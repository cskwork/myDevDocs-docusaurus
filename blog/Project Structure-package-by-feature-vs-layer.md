### Package by feature
- place all items related to a single feature into a single directory.
- Has high modularity 
- Items related to the feature are within the package
EX)
```
├── com.app
    └── company
        ├── Company
        ├── CompanyController
        ├── CompanyRepository        
        └── CompanyService
    └── product
        ├── Product   
        ├── ProductController
        ├── ProductRepository
        └── ProductService
    └── util
    └── user
        ├── User   
        ├── UserController
        ├── UserRepository
        └── UserService
```

### Package by layer/type
- Feature is spread out over multiple loose categories. 
- Has Low cohesion and modularity. 
- separated by application layers. 
- utilized in layered architectures as decoupling mechanism. (has to make public)
```
├── com.app
    └── controller
        ├── CompanyController
        ├── ProductController
        └── UserController
    └── model
        ├── Company   
        ├── Product
        └── User
    └── repository
        ├── CompanyRepository   
        ├── ProductRepository
        └── UserRepository
    └── service
        ├── CompanyService
        ├── ProductService
        └── UserService
    └── util
```

### Winner? -> Package by feature 
For business application package by feature far outweights package by layer due to high modularity, easier code navigation, higher level of abstractions, bettter growth.(MSA)
